About the Java language, which one below is NOT correct?
#OPTIONS
A redefinition of a superclass method in a subclass need not have the same signature as the superclass method. Such a redefinition is not method overriding but is simply an example of method overloading.
A constructor is a special method with the same name as the class that is used to initialize the members of a class object. Constructors are called when objects of their classes are instantiated.
A method declared static has a special way to access non-static class members. Using this reference, static methods are able to access all members of that class.
An array subscript may be an integer or an integer expression. If a program uses an expression as a subscript, then the expression is evaluated to determine the particular element of the array.
